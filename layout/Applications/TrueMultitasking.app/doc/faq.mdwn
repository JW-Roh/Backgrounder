> # Why would I want to use Backgrounder on iOS 4.0?
> - - -
> While iOS 4.0 includes multitasking support, existing apps must be rebuilt to take advantage of it; otherwise the apps quit just as with older firmware. Backgrounder provides an option to allow *all* apps, even those that have not been rebuilt, to use iOS 4.0's "fast app switching" feature.
>
> Also, with iOS 4.0's multitasking enabled, all apps that support it will automatically use it; the user has no choice. With Backgrounder, the user can decide which apps are allowed to stay loaded.

> # Why does Backgrounder slow down my device?
> - - -
> Having Backgrounder installed on a device will not slow it down or waste memory; running (processor/memory-intensive) apps in the background will.
>
> Apps that offically support true backgrounding, such as Apple's Phone, Mail, iPod and Safari, are designed to use less resources when backgrounded. Most apps, though, are not designed for background use; even when backgrounded, they will continue to run as if they are in the foreground (and thus continue to unnecessarily update GUI elements, etc.).

> # Can I hide the badge on Phone/Mail/etc.?
> - - -
> If the Badge option is set to "ON" in the global settings, the badge will be enabled for all apps.
>
> To disable the badge for a given app, such as Phone, an "override" must be added.
>
> To add an override:
>
> 1. On the main screen, tap Overrides.
> 1. On the Overrides screen, if the app is not already listed, tap Add, and select the app from the popup list.
> 1. On the Overrides screen, tap the app to view its settings.
> 1. Set the badge option to "OFF"
> 1. Close this preferences app.
> 1. Wait for SpringBoard (the home screen app) to restart.

> # Why does the badge show briefly after closing an app?
> - - -
> This can happen when using the "Native" backgrounding method.
>
> Not all apps support native backgrounding. For those apps, the badge will be displayed on the icon, but then removed shortly after when the app fails to background (i.e. when it quits).

> # Can I use my own badge images?
> - - -
> Yes. The badge image files are located at:
>
>         /System/Library/CoreServices/
>            SpringBoard.app/
>            Backgrounder_*Badge.png
>
> Overwriting these files is **not** recommended, though, as they will be replaced with each Backgrounder upgrade.
>
> Instead, the recommended method is to use WinterBoard (by Jay Freeman, available for free via Cydia).
>
> The WinterBoard path for the "Native" badge is:

>         Some.theme/Bundles/
>            com.apple.springboard/
>            Backgrounder_NativeBadge.png

> # Can I use my own status bar icon images?

> Yes. As with badges, the recommended method is to use WinterBoard.
