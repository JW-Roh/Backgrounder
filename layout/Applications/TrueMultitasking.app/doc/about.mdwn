> Backgrounder allows for total control of backgrounding on an iPhone/iOS-based device.
>
> With Backgrounder, *you* decide when an app should keep running, and when it should quit.
>
> Backgrounder provides true backgrounding; minimized apps can be made to continue to run as if they were still the foreground app.
>
> The iPhone OS has always supported backgrounding. However, only certain Apple applications, such as Phone, Mail, iPod and Safari, are officially able to run in the background. Backgrounder simply enables this capability for *all* applications.
