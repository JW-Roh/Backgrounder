> iOS 4.x includes several multitasking methods: voip, audio, gps, continuous, and task-completion. All of these allow an app to continue processing while in the background.
>
> For apps that do not support any of these methods, iOS 4.x also includes fast app switching, which keeps the app loaded in memory in a paused state so that it can be quickly resumed.
>
> * **Off:**  
>   Apps that do not support one of the voip/audio/gps/continuous methods will quit when minimized.
>
>   Apps that use task-completion will quit once the tasks have completed.

>   Apps will remain loaded in memory when minimized.
